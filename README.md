Medi-Co is web portal for Primary Medical Consulting. Here we have proposed a system that connects 
patients to available doctors for online appointments. Our system aims to build an environment where various 
patients who're in need of doctor's help at can reach out to the doctors, tell them their issues and discuss 
remedies. It also consists of doctorâ€™s login panel where doctor may login to the system and then see patient 
requests for appointments. The system then schedules those requests and serves them to doctor one after 
another. This allows doctors to confirm appointment with patients and discuss their problems. At the end of 
the consultation doctor may send them an online subscription in a printable word format so that they may 
directly print it and get medicines based on that subscription. The system will prove helpful to urgent cases. 
This system supports local community for awareness and counselling programs, and help to empower 
people with the knowledge to safeguard and manage their own health.
